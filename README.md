# 🌱 Malina Coin (MLN)

**Malina Coin** is a utility-focused crypto project that rewards smart energy usage and enables a real-world, day-to-day digital currency powered by energy behavior.

This repository contains the **code, experiments, and technical building blocks** of Malina.

The **whitepaper lives in this repository**, but this README is intentionally different:

* The whitepaper explains *why* Malina exists
* This README explains *what this repo is* and *how to think about the system*

If you are here to understand the philosophy and economics, read the whitepaper.
If you are here to build, audit, or contribute, start here.

## 🚀 What is Malina?

Malina is an **energy-behavior coordination system**.

Instead of rewarding speculation, Malina rewards **correct electricity usage**, starting with EV charging and expanding to smart-metered home energy.

Use energy at the right time → earn MLN → spend MLN in daily life.

---

## ❓ Why Malina exists

Today’s problems:

* EVs and homes consume energy heavily during peak hours
* Power grids face stress and costly upgrades
* Most cryptocurrencies have no real-world utility

Malina solves this by:

* Shifting energy usage away from peak hours
* Rewarding users for grid-friendly behavior
* Creating a utility-backed daily transaction coin

---

## ⚙️ How it works (high level)

1. **Energy usage is measured**

   * EV chargers (via standard protocols like OCPP)
   * Smart meters for home energy

2. **Time-based validation**

   * Was the energy consumed during an optimal window?

3. **Reward issuance**

   * If yes → MLN is issued
   * If no → no reward

4. **Daily usage**

   * MLN is spent on charging, discounts, services, and partners

No manual claims. No self-reporting. No fake data.

## 🪙 What makes MLN different

| Bitcoin             | Malina Coin                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Store of value      | Daily-life utility currency |
| Time-based scarcity | Problem-based scarcity      |
| Mining ends by date | Minting ends by success     |
| Not behavior-linked | Earned through contribution |

Malina is designed for **circulation**, not hoarding.

---

## 🔄 Token lifecycle

* Early stage: high rewards to fix bad energy behavior
* Middle stage: rewards reduce as behavior improves
* Mature stage: minimal minting, MLN used mainly for transactions

When the problem disappears, rewards disappear.
That is a feature, not a bug.

---

## 🛡️ Trust & verification

* Utility-grade energy data
* Server-side session validation
* No screenshots, no manual uploads
* Same measurement systems used for billing

Fraud surface is intentionally minimal.

---

## 🏗️ Repository purpose

This repo may include:

* Smart contracts
* Backend logic
* Energy data verification modules
* Token logic and integrations

It is intended for **developers, auditors, and contributors**.

---

## 🧭 Roadmap (simplified)

* EV charging pilots
* Smart meter integrations
* Utility partnerships
* Daily-use MLN payments
* Gradual transition to community governance

---

## 🌍 Vision

Malina aims to become:

* A global energy-incentive protocol
* A standard for smart energy consumption
* A real-world daily transaction currency

Energy will always exist.
Coordination will always have value.
